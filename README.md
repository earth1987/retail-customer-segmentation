# Retail customer segmentation

The aim of this project is to conduct customer segmentation using a clustering algorithm. This will involve dividing a diverse customer base into smaller, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics like demographics, behavior, or preferences. This strategy is invaluable as it enables businesses to tailor their marketing efforts, products, and services to each segment's specific needs and preferences. By doing so, companies can enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. Moreover, it allows for more efficient resource allocation, helping businesses focus their resources where they are most likely to yield the highest returns.

# Scope
The dataset has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/customer-segmentation-clustering) The data contains customer information collected from a mall's membership cards.
